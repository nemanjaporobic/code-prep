Minimum front characters to be added for palindrome
Last Updated : 23 Jul, 2024
Given string str we need to tell minimum characters to be added in front of the string to make string palindrome.

Examples: 

    Input  : str = "ABC"
    Output : 2
    We can make above string palindrome as "CBABC" 
    by adding 'B' and 'C' at front.

    Input  : str = "AACECAAAA";
    Output : 2
    We can make above string palindrome as AAAACECAAAA
    by adding two A's at front of string.
