KMP Algorithm for Pattern Searching
Last Updated : 01 Aug, 2024
Given two strings txt and pat of size N and M, where N > M. String txt and pat represent the text 
and pattern respectively. The task is to print all indexes of occurrences of pattern string in the text string. 
Use one-based indexing while returning the indices.

Examples:

    Input:  txt = “THIS IS A TEST TEXT”, pat = “TEST”
    Output: Pattern found at index 10

    Input:  txt=  “AABAACAADAABAABA”
              pat =  “AABA”
    Output: Pattern found at index 0, Pattern found at index 9, Pattern found at index 12
