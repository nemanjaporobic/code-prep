Longest Repeating Subsequence
Last Updated : 17 Feb, 2023
Given a string, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence, such that the two subsequences 
donâ€™t have same string character at the same position, i.e. any ith character in the two subsequences 
should not have the same index in the original string.

Examples:

    Input: str = "abc"
    Output: 0
    There is no repeating subsequence

    Input: str = "aab"
    Output: 1
    The two subsequence are 'a'(first) and 'a'(second). 
    Note that 'b' cannot be considered as part of subsequence 
    as it would be at same index in both.

    Input: str = "aabb"
    Output: 2

    Input: str = "axxxy"
    Output: 2
