Check if a given string is a rotation of a palindrome
Last Updated : 07 Jul, 2022
Given a string, check if it is a rotation of a palindrome. For example your function should return true for “aab” 
as it is a rotation of “aba”. 

Examples: 

    Input:  str = "aaaad"
    Output: 1  
    // "aaaad" is a rotation of a palindrome "aadaa"

    Input:  str = "abcd"
    Output: 0
    // "abcd" is not a rotation of any palindrome.
