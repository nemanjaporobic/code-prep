Longest Palindromic Substring
Last Updated : 01 Sep, 2024
Given a string str, the task is to find the longest substring which is a palindrome. 
If there are multiple answers, then return the first appearing substring.

Examples:

    Input: str = “forgeeksskeegfor” 
    Output: “geeksskeeg”
    Explanation: There are several possible palindromic substrings like “kssk”, “ss”, “eeksskee” etc. 
    But the substring “geeksskeeg” is the longest among all.

    Input: str = “Geeks” 
    Output: “ee”

    Input: str = “abc” 
    Output: “a”

    Input: str = “” 
    Output: “”
