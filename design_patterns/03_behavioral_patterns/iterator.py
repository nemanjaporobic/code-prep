# Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that allows sequential traversal through a complex data structure without
# exposing its internal details.
#
# Thanks to the Iterator, clients can go over elements of different collections in a similar fashion using a single
# iterator interface.
#
# Complexity: xx
# Popularity: xxx
#
# Usage examples: The pattern is very common in Python code. Many frameworks and libraries use it to provide a
# standard way for traversing their collections.
#
# Identification: Iterator is easy to recognize by the navigation methods (such as next, previous and others).
# Client code that uses iterators might not have direct access to the collection being traversed.
#
# Conceptual Example
# This example illustrates the structure of the Iterator design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:
#
# What classes does it consist of?
# What roles do these classes play?
# In what way the elements of the pattern are related?
