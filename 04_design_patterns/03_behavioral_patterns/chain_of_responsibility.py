# Chain of Responsibility is behavioral design pattern that allows passing request along the chain of potential
# handlers until one of them handles request.
#
# The pattern allows multiple objects to handle the request without coupling sender class to the concrete classes
# of the receivers. The chain can be composed dynamically at runtime with any handler that follows a standard handler
# interface.
#
# Complexity: xx
# Popularity: xx
#
# Usage examples: The Chain of Responsibility is pretty common in Python. It’s mostly relevant when your code operates
# with chains of objects, such as filters, event chains, etc.
#
# Identification: The pattern is recognizable by behavioral methods of one group of objects that indirectly call the
# same methods in other objects, while all the objects follow the common interface.
#
# Conceptual Example
# This example illustrates the structure of the Chain of Responsibility design pattern. It focuses on answering these
# questions:
#
# What classes does it consist of?
# What roles do these classes play?
# In what way the elements of the pattern are related?
